# Develop BeyondSEO

The repository includes the native engine, source catalog, portable skill and local fixtures. Keep client reports, captured website content, credentials and run outputs outside the source tree.

## Prepare the environment

```sh
python3 scripts/setup.py --dev
```

Activate `.venv` with `source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux, or `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in Windows PowerShell. Windows users can replace `python3` with `py -3` for setup.

Install optional local hosting fixtures when working on SFTP/FTPS behavior:

```sh
python -m pip install -e '.[hosting-test]'
```

## Check a change

```sh
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
python scripts/check_docs.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
beyondseo doctor
```

The suite includes deterministic fixtures for discovery fallbacks, empty/parser failures, permission categories, provenance, business-profile/competitor gates, incomplete evidence and browser setup. It also uses local fixtures for HTTP/browser crawling, extraction, robots and sitemap behavior, reputation calculations, catalog import and selection, planning, installation and file changes. Optional hosting fixtures require their corresponding dependencies. A fixture verifies defined behavior; it does not establish another website's availability or a client's search performance.

Development setup includes ReportLab and the test-only `pypdf` reader for report integration checks. They verify preserved evidence, escaped content, pagination, navigation, the exact logo, partial-output handling and font limitations. Client PDFs and visual QA renders stay outside the repository.

The [repository workflow](https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo/actions/workflows/tests.yml) runs across Linux, Windows and macOS with Python 3.10 and 3.12. Keep regressions reproducible and independent of external websites remaining unchanged.

## Update the posting library

Use [the posting guide](backlink-posting-guide.md) for the optional PDF importer and catalog structure. Preserve original source rows, unverified metric labels and dated primary-source guidance. Review exact posting routes, eligibility and content rules before qualifying an entry. Keep account-specific or client-specific observations outside the shared catalog.

## Build a skill upload asset

From reviewed source, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_skill.py
python3 scripts/build_skill.py --out ../release-assets/beyondseo-2.9.1-skill.zip
```

The builder keeps the complete runtime and resources under one `beyondseo/` folder and emits a SHA-256 sidecar. Developer tests and local environments stay outside the bundle. Existing output archives are preserved. Check that the archive, tag and version fields describe the same source before attaching the ZIP and checksum to a release. Runtime tests, a format check and a host's installation decision establish different things; report their results separately.
